## Description
Comic Soon is a hands-on project for me to dive into web development languages and tools. 

The idea is to build a website about comics with various pages, including a homepage, gallery, comics page, signup/login page, about page, and a search feature that lives within the comics page.

This project is all about learning as I go. I've already sketched out some basic designs for a few pages, and I might add those to the repo later.

I’ve also started using linters in this project, so that should be fun!

## Project Goals
This project is all about learning as I go and honing my web development skills.

## Technologies Used
I’ve added the following linters to this project’s development dependencies:
- HtmlHint
- StyleLint
- ESLint

## Project Structure
The source code and main project files are located in the "src" folder. The organization within this folder is quite intuitive and straightforward.
